# Project Description:
# In today's highly competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is a top priority.
# "Churn," or the rate at which customers switch to a different telecom service provider, is a critical metric for telecom companies. 
# This project focuses on addressing this challenge by leveraging the power of data science and logistic regression.
# Churn prediction is a key application in customer relationship management for telecom companies. 
# The goal of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that can identify potential churners, i.e., customers who are likely to switch to another provider. 
# We accomplish this by analyzing historical customer data, including usage patterns, billing information, and customer demographics.
# The core of this project is the implementation of logistic regression, a widely used machine learning algorithm for binary classification. 
# By feeding relevant customer data into the logistic regression model, we can estimate the likelihood of a customer churning. 
# This enables telecom companies to proactively take measures to retain at-risk customers, whether through tailored marketing campaigns, service improvements, or other strategies.
# This project's README will guide you through the process of training the logistic regression model, evaluating its performance, and interpreting the results. 
# By leveraging this predictive model, telecom companies can enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn, ultimately benefiting both the industry and its customers.
